## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ebenezer and this account is a showcase of stuff that I like working on and many more to come.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Sudoku app since I love puzzles. After that, Iâ€™m going to code a chess game.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js, node.js, and potentially some SQL to store data.

- âš¡ About Me: I enjoy sports, playing music, and puzzles. I believe that everything around us may have areas for improvement, there may be problems but there's always a solution for every problem. One of the main reasons I got into coding is that there are so many things we can do with it, and the more we advance, the more we need the tools to help us get to our goals. I believe that coding is my way of helping people reach where they need to go.
